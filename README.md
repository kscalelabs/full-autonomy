# Full Autonomy Whitebook

This whitebook outlines our expected timeline towards making our humanoid robot fully autonomous. It is a working document outlining how we expect the trajectory to look like, but we will almost certainly make updates and changes as we learn from deploying our robots in the real world. Additionally, we intend to use this document to solicit feature requests from robot owners on what features we should build along the way.
