# Contributing

This repository is a working document outlining K-Scale's roadmap towards full autonomy. It is the easiest way to provide input on features you would like to see built.

## Getting Started

- Fork the repo and clone it on your machine.
- Create a branch (`git checkout -b request/myRequestName`).

## Community and Communication

The best starting point for discussing your ideas is in our [Discord](https://url.kscale.dev/discord).

For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change. Please make sure to update tests as appropriate, and try to reduce verbosity and annotate your code as much as possible

Thank you for contributing!
